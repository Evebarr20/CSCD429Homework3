# CSCD429Homework3
## Data Description: The dataset synthetic_control_data.txt contains 600 examples of control chart
time series data. The data is stored in an ASCII file, 600 rows, 60 columns, with a single chart
per line. There are six different classes of control charts:
o Normal
o Cyclic
o Increasing trend
o Decreasing trend
o Upward shift
o Downward shift
The following image shows ten examples from each class: (A) Downward Trend. (B) Cyclic. (C)
Normal. (D) Upward Shift. (E) Upward Trend. (F) Downward Shift.

## Task Description:
### 1) Clustering: implement k-means clustering algorithm from scratch using Java to find six

clusters from control chart data. Once the clusters are formed, extract the examples that
belong to the same cluster into a .txt file. Altogether, your program should output six .txt
files.

### 2) Clustering and Visualization using R: use R to generate six clusters from control chart
data, and use R to visualize the six clusters.
